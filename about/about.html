      <h2>Background profile</h2>
      <h3>Academic</h3>
      <p>I studied at Imperial College in London during four years towards a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering with a focus on Electrical Engineering. My final year thesis was focused on the use of bioinformatics and high-throughput image analysis in an attempt to quantify the probablities of metastasis in cancer cells. The more advanced modules taken whilst at Imperial include Advanced Signal Processing and Machine Intelligence, Brain-Machine Interfaces and Computational Neuroscience.</p>
      <h3>Professional</h3>
      <p>After my first year at university, I started practicing with popular development microprocessors; Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and eventually with ESP32. The logical component to digital systems and embedded programming still remains a very interesting part of the job that I do to this day. At the beginning, I used microprocessors to retrieve information from a varied range of sensors. Once I understood the practicalities of Bluetooth and WiFi, I started using these two as ways of transferring information from the microprocessor (whilst understanding UART, SPI and I2C communications).</p>
      <p>In my first job as an undegraduate, I was lucky to work on the back-end of website services and deal with Amazon Web Services, Dockers, and other software solutions used to close the loop in IoT and mobile applications.</p>
      <p>Currently, I am enjoying the responsibilites and challenges in the Research and Development department of a medical device company. It's already provided me with countless learning opportunities and I continue to grow everyday, not only as a competent Software Engineer but also as a young adult. In this website, I am hoping to share discussion points and project ideas, in the hopes that others could benefit from my input.</p>


<!--        <div class="about_page">
        <p>This page is intended to store and organise all of my articles, which deliberately may follow no specific theme. As a recent graduate out of an engineering degree, I am well-versed in different technologies and have the ability (and luck) to learn about new topics fairly easily. I am trying out writing as a method to make my learning and knowledge more permanent than simply reading, listening and watching content. I hope, in the process, I am able to help others finding something they didn't know before.</p>

        <h3>About the author</h3>
        <p>Hi there, this is Marta on the keyboard. I'm a 20-something year old, with a recent "Engineering of something" degree, from a fairly popular, headline-making university located in London. You are bound to discover the details in some of my articles, or perhaps in my CV. The thing is, it doesn't really matter. </p>
        <p> What really matters is that, I am enthusiastic about change in all its different forms. Perhaps I have a stronger inclination towards technological change, because I am more capable of evaluating the reality behind vague promises and the muted world-changers. But, at this point in my life, I am hungry for new ideas and seeing how they could develop. Especially in the current climate, where clever change is so important. I wanted to dedicate my time to promote the good and great ideas that could lead to a better future. </p>
