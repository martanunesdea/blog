        <p>Hi there, this is Marta on the keyboard. I'm a 20-something year old, with a recent Master's in Engineering degree. I am incredibly grateful to be working in something that I enjoy and where I see true value. In my free time, I enjoy reading about new technologies and innovations, as well as to the business and financials of different sectors (I attended finance and business modules from ICBS and I'm pleased to say a lot of it proved to be very useful!). This page is intended to be an "anchor" for all the sorts of topics I may feel like writing about.</p>
        <h3>Short bio</h3>
        <p>After my first year at university, I started practicing with popular development microprocessors; Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and eventually with ESP32. The logical component to digital systems and embedded programming still remains a very interesting part of the job that I do to this day. At the beginning, I used microprocessors to retrieve information from a varied range of sensors. Once I understood the practicalities of Bluetooth and WiFi, I started using these two as ways of transferring information from the microprocessor (whilst also using UART, SPI and I2C communications).</p>
        <p>I took advantage of a few university summer holidays to explore, in more detail, the development of embedded systems for medical applications. This was the first step in the right direction, one that was leading me towards the extraordinary world of computer science, to delve deeper into topics that I had always been really curious about: computer architecture, operating systems, networks and protocols. This led me to take a second step in this direction, as I chose to dedicate the two last years of university in modules in the department of Electrical Engineering. This later proved to have been a great decision, as I saw myself getting involved in projects relating to wearable devices with biosensors, human-interfacing robots and decoding recordings of neuron signals to predict movement. Happy times. </p>
        <p>In my first job as a graduate, I was lucky to work on the back-end of website services and deal with Amazon Web Services, Dockers, and other software solutions used to close the loop in IoT and mobile applications.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am enjoying the responsibilites and challenges in the Research and Development department of a medical device company. It's already provided me with countless learning opportunities and I continue to grow everyday, not only as a competent Software Engineer but also as a young adult. In this website, I am hoping to share discussion points and project ideas, in the hopes that others could benefit from my input.</p>
