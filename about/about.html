        <p>This page is intended to store and organise all of my articles, which deliberately may follow no specific theme. As a recent graduate out of an engineering degree, I am well-versed in different technologies and have the ability (and luck) to learn about new topics fairly easily. I am trying out writing as a method to make my learning and knowledge more permanent than simply reading, listening and watching content. I hope, in the process, I am able to help others finding something they didn't know before.</p>

        <h3>About the author</h3>
        <p>Hi there, this is Marta on the keyboard. I'm a 20-something year old, with a recent "Engineering of something" degree, from a fairly popular, headline-making university located in London. You are bound to discover the details in some of my articles, or perhaps in my CV. The thing is, it doesn't really matter. </p>
        <p> What really matters is that, I am enthusiastic about change in all its different forms. Perhaps I have a stronger inclination towards technological change, because I am more capable of evaluating the reality behind vague promises and the muted world-changers. But, at this point in my life, I am hungry for new ideas and seeing how they could develop. Especially in the current climate, where clever change is so important. I wanted to dedicate my time to promote the good and great ideas that could lead to a better future. </p>
