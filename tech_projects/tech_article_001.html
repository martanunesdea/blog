      <h3>Step 1: Research about what sensors to include</h3>
      <p>Because this station is to be used in a sailing environment, I decided to incorporate a few extra things that I wouldn't need in a conventional home weather station.</p>
      <h3>Step 2: Design circuit needed to assemble sensors to board</h3>
      <p>Most sensors have suggested circuit designs on their technical datasheet. Regardless of the application, we'll always have to check the voltage at which it runs, current tolerance levels, etc. Depending on the specific sensor using, you may need to consider temperature tolerance levels, humidity, surrounding interference, etc. </p>
      <h3>Step 3: Procure all added components to incororate onto the electronics build</h3>
