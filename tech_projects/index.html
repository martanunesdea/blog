        <p>One of the oldest on the list of projects that I would do if I had time at university...</p>
        <!-- <p>This "Weather Station" will start off as a basic reader for temperature, humidity and pressure, possibly attached to a LCD.
          The sensor readings will then be configured to be sent over Bluetooth to a nearby phone.
          Further additions to this little device will be:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A rain sensor.</li>
            <li>A wind measuring system (galvometer).</li>
            <li>Levels of light and UV intensity.</li>
            <li>A camera capturing system.</li>
            <li>Posting the results to a known website (TBC).</li>
          </ul>
        <p>This product is being design with the aim of introducing at a sailing club, thus the importance given to connectivity. There are a multitude of other things that could be added, depending on the setting for the weather station.</p>
