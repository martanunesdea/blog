      <h3>Step 1: Choose the wood for the coasdters</h3>
      <p>Something with the right dimensions and that will look nice in your home.</p>
      <h3>Step 2: Straight cuts</h3>
      <p>Cut the log in several slices of the same width. This might be tricky if your saw is not sharp.</p>
      <h3>Step 3: Sand the top surface</h3>
      <p>Depending on how smooth your cuts are, it might be nice to sand your top surface a little bit. I sanded down to a grit where the nice rounded circles of the wood were visible. There's no need to sand the bottom surface since that will only make it more slippery when you put it down.</p>
      <h3>Step 3: Oil it!</h3>
      <p>Make sure you protect the dry wood from any moisture, scratches, heat, anything that could damage the wood really! We went for three coats of boiled linseed oil.</p>
