        <h2>A review Humankind</h2>
        <p>Sapiens has become a globally popular title in the past few years, and to an extent, I am very pleased that it has educated masses of people on something as basic as human evolution. However, throughout the entire book I kept on coming up with "buts" to the author's claims and statements. <p>
        <p>In fact, I was so mildly dissappointed with the contents of the book, that I went out and read "History of the World" by Andrew Marr, in an attempt to find a book that would offer an unbiased tell of tales of how History actually happened.</p>
