        <h2>The unexpected outcome of.. creativity</h2>

        <p>Since this lockdown has started, I have been trying my best to be proactive with my time and energy. Together with Joseph, we've always been doing one form of exercise per day (mostly to satisfy his apple watch-driven motivation to be active). But also in terms of using this time to deepen my knowledge in engineering, and learning a few skills that I would not have had time to do before!</p>

        <h3>Baking ! oh yes so original</h3>

I'm not ashamed, because no one else on Instagram is either. I mean, at the end of the day, is possibly the most useful thing to do after cooking, right?</p>
