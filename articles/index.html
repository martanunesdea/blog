    <!--    <p>From my time working in a start-up in the health-technology sector I understood the importance of business in engineering. It is funny how at university, we think the business side of things is the "evil" as well as the "less gifted" because they are not asked to evaluate 3-dimensional integral calculus problems. While, I don't blame them, that stuff is nasty.</p>
        <p>However, and I must give some credit to those engineering and science undergraduates, it is true that not everyone in the financial or business world is reputable enough to make that a respectable field. There is a lot of people chasing "castles in the air"[1], the fast-track way to success and wealth without delivering anything of value and without really serving a purpose. Unfortunately, the field gets its fame from these, rather than the "angels". Those willing to invest in high-risk projects, in recent graduates with a genius idea but not a clue on how to deliver. We don't hear from those willing to listen and to have their minds changed in order to do things in a better way. And to be honest, I am not really sure how many of these people exist in the business world. But my hope is that there are some; otherwise we wouldn't be where we are.</p> -->
