      <h2>Background</h2>
      <h3>Academic</h3>
      <p>Studied at Imperial College in London during four years towards a Master's in Biomedical Engineering with a focus on Electrical Engineering. My master's thesis was centered on the use of bioinformatics and high-throughput image analysis to study the prolific nature of cancer cells. The more advanced modules taken whilst at Imperial include Advanced Signal Processing and Machine Intelligence, Brain-Machine Interfaces and Computational Neuroscience.</p>
      <h3>Professional</h3>
      <p>After my first year at university, I started practicing with readily available microprocessors; Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and eventually with ESP32. The logical component to digital systems and embedded programming still remains a very interesting part of the job that I do to this day. At the beginning, I used microprocessors to talk to a varied range of compatible sensors. Once I understood the practicalities of Bluetooth and WiFi, I started using these two as ways of communicating information. In my first job as an undegraduate, I was lucky to work on the back-end of website services and deal with Amazon Web Services, Dockers, and the components used to close the loop in IoT applications.</p>
      <h2>Present</h2>
      <h3>Engineering</h3>
      <p>I am now happily working as a Software Engineer in Research and Development and enjoying the learning opportunities that the job offers; there are always multiple different problems to be solving, in parallel with new project ideas to do some research about... However, outside my work hours I am looking to implement some of those projects that I never really had time to finish whilst at university. And at the same time, I am discovering a lot of other new things that I'd like to learn about. Follow my journey...</p>
      <h3>Business and Innovation</h3>
      <p>Apart from the exciting technical aspects about software engineering, I have an optimistic feeling that technology can help drive innovation and that can in turn drive businesses and economies. I have been a firm believer in sustainable development ever since I was a Model United Nations delegate learning about the new millenium goals. And after graduating from Imperial, I believe so even more.</p>
