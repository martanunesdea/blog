        <h2>Project Rationale</h2>
        <p>Writing this program in C++ is partially driven by the enthusiasm to have more flexibility in software design (as compared to C), and partially because I am curious to see the differences from C++ to Python libraries. I used SpaCy about two years ago, and it was already very user-friendly back in the day. However, since it was based on Cython, I was left with the curiosity to try NLP in the C++ environment.

        <h3>Day 1 of getting started</h3>
        <p>I have practiced a few exercises of text handling in C++ with the fstream header file original from C++ and that's been working as expected. However, the popularly used getline(fstream, string) function call is not very useful for long text files. And, since I will want to use this program for more than just CSVs, I have started exploring third-party libraries that could help me with text processing.</p>
        <h4>Candidate number 1: MITIE</h4>
        <p>The acronym stands for MIT Information Extraction. This is a project developed by MIT to provide freely available tools for named entity recognition and relation extraction. As far as my research discovered, this was part of a DARPA project and since it was from the academic world I reckoned the performance would be considerably high. However, I have so far not had much success in getting much out of their well-curated library (built on top of dlib).</p>
        <p>According to the github page, we should be able to use MITIE from command line calls (i.e. as a program that can process text input) or, use it as a shared library (in theory in different languages). I have attempted to implement both, following the suggested commands and trying similar things but in different ways, and I have not yet managed. The fact that the project has not been maintained in a few years is not very encouraging either. I will definitely want to give this another go, but for the time being I will be looking at another candidate...</p>
        <h4>Candidate number 2: CRF++</h4>
