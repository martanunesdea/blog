        <h2>Project Rationale</h2>
        <p>Writing this program in C++ is partially driven by the enthusiasm to have more flexibility in software design (as compared to C), and partially because I am curious to see the differences from C++ to Python libraries. I used SpaCy about two years ago, and it was already very user-friendly back in the day. However, since it was based on Cython, I was left with the curiosity to try NLP in the C++ environment.

        <h3>Day 1 - Getting started</h3>
        <p>I have practiced the C++ capabilities with input streams when using the fstream header file and thatÂ´s been working as expected. I can separate text files into words and add those onto a vector.</p>
        <p>I will be researching a bit and brushing up on tokenization next, I would like to have a rough idea on the topic of the document... </p>

        <h3>Day 2 - Vector operations</h3>
        <p>I have realised I will probably have to rely on
