        <p>This present website was completely implemented by me, with self-taught concepts on HTML, CSS and Javascript. And this is how I was told one develops website a few years ago. I actually enrolled on a short, introductory course in HTML and CSS in my first year of university, so I knew where to get started when I continued learning it by myself.</p>
        <p>Nowadays there are several frameworks for web development (Angular, React, VueJS are widely known even to non-web developers like me). I've been meaning to develop and deploy a nicer website for a while, so I decided to dig deeper into one of these frameworks and see how it goes.</p>
