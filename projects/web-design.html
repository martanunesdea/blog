        <h1 class="heading"><a href="#">Getting started with Web Design</a></h2>
        <p>This present website was completely implemented by me, with self-taught concepts on HTML, CSS and Javascript. And this is how I was told one develops website a few years ago. I actually enrolled on a short, introductory course in HTML and CSS in my first year of university, so I knew where to get started when I continued learning it by myself.</p>
        <p>Nowadays there are several frameworks for web development (Angular, React, VueJS are widely known even to non-web developers like me). I've been meaning to develop and deploy a nicer website for a while, so I decided to dig deeper into one of these frameworks and see how it goes.</p>
        <h3>Javascript for C/C++ developers</h3>
        <p>For someone working in the embedded systems sector (or, as I think of it, the other side of the fence from web and app development), I've seen a growing demand for Javascript developers. There is a lot of buzz and hype about many different frameworks (which seem to me to have very similar purposes), but the common factor across all of these is its compatibility or dependency within Javascript. Even the front end design is now mostly Javascript (the popular frameworks seem to have changed traditional web design). So, learning Javascript is fairly essential to unlocking the potential behind web technologies.</p>
        <h3>Dynamically typed language</h3>
        <p>Javascript is not a compiled language, which is perhaps the biggest (and to me, a bit worrying) difference from C and C++. I will attempt to explain the technical implications of this aspect at some point later on, but for now this is simply a note to self that, Javascript will not detect issues until the very end, but at the same time I am not as worried about variables declarations and garbage collection.</p>
        <h3>Object-oriented but also functional</h3>
        <p>I've read from authors claiming that Javascript lends itself well for both practices. Even though I am excited to experiment with functional programming, I will be aiming to mostly use Javascript in an "object-oriented inspired" way. If anything, I will be tending to the procedural practices of C more than to functional simply because this is what I am used to.</p>
        <h3>Types of data types/objects</h3>
        <p>So far, I have mostly seen that Javascript uses "let" as a means to avoid having to define a specific data type. Very broadly, Javascript will categorise the variables declared into: Number, Boolean, String, Arrays or Objects.</p>
        <p>When it comes to numbers, Javascript is agnostic to integers, float, double, long double, it's all a "Number". I'm very onboard with this. The numerical operators work in similar ways to C and C++ (or, when differing, in simpler ways). The operational precedence follows the actual math rules (multiply and divide before addition and subtraction) and parantheses will be considered before anything. Apart from that, Javascript has dedicated methods for each data type, which are particularly useful for "strings" and "arrays". To identify the data type, the function "typeof()" will provide the answer.</p>
        <h4>Conditionals and loops</h4>
        <p>With regards to syntax and usage, Javascript employs similar conditional functions (if/else, switch/break statements) as well as loops (for, while, do while). It has a few other loops, such as for...in and for...of and the labeled statement. Apart from that, the syntax and behaviours are as one would expect. I suppose the discerning part is the usage for some of these functions but so far so good.</p>
