In essence, I am hoping to connect a microphone to an esp32 board, perhaps do a bit of pre-processing from the board and then send the data wirelessly. Once the data is in a bit of a more powerful machine, I will try to use more advanced filtering and algorithms to process the audio. If all goes well, I will try to use the final speech output as the input for a future NLP project (this would be separately implemented to avoid complications, and to enable me to work on different things concurrently).
